The opportunity arrived after Mount was penalised for a contested foul on the edge of the box, a decision that drew complaints from Tuchel but handed Marcus Rashford the chance to take aim.
The England striker had scored a free-kick here last season in the Carabao Cup to seal victory for United and his latest effort tested Mendy, forcing the Blues keeper to watch the ballâ€™s flight carefully and punch it away.
In the aftermath, the bouncing ball appeared to strike an arm as Greenwood and Hudson-Odoi challenged for it and the VAR recommended referee Stuart Attwell review the incident again on the pitchside monitor. After careful consideration, the evidence was deemed inconclusive.
